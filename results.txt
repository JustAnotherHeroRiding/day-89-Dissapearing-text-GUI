�It�s so beautiful,� he said, 
�I�m going to take a picture.�,I knew 
it was fruitless to say anything at this moment. 
I have been preparing to lay it out for him but i time and time again i have stopped. 
I just wanted to tell him that his obsession with buying expensive cameras to take pictures 
nobody will ever look at has ruined us financially and i could not take his childish attempts 
at living fantasies. 

What if the Forest was actually a magical portal to another dimension, 
the Forest was a portal to the Otherworld?,The forest was just a forest. 
This is what i always believed. One day i decided to put all those talks to the test. 
I went to the forest alone, at night with a night and some food and coffee for the morning after. 
Early into the evening i started hearing the forest wake up as the regular world of people went to 
sleep to prepare for another day of hard work. I heard what felt like roots moving deep down inside 
the earth but obviosly it could not have been roots. An animal or the wind was the most logical 
explanation and i kept my calm. As the night became deeper is when i got my first view of just how 
alive the forest can be when nobody is looking, or it thinks nobody is looking. I started hearing 
footsteps, but they did not sound human or like any animal i have ever seen. I heard a distant 
conversation in a language once again unlike any that is familiar to me, a linguist who has spent 
his entire life studying languages only to be stupedified on his first night in the world of trees, 
a place where i thought language played no role and nature took it's course without needing to say 
anything about it. It's what i've always respected about the wilderness. It had no use for words 
and did not need thousands of them to get simple tasks done. The better of a linguist i became the 
less i spoke. The true goal of mine has always been to say much without saying too many words. 
A word too many has always been root of humanity's mistakes. An important skill i learned in my years
in the University has been when to keep my mouth shut and when to jump in for an opportunity to say 
something of worth. As i go inside of this whirlwind of theory and thinking and books and universities
the strange tongue sounded like it was getting nearer to me until it suddenly grew silent. 
I thought i heard something open and the voices dissapeared, so being the logical man that i 
thought i was i went to investigate. I found something that has changed the course of my life in that 
little investigation spell that took over me. I might speak of it some other day, but today i think 
i said more than enough. For my own safety, if not everybody else's.
